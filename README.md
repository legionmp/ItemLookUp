# ItemLookUp
Addon for Classic WoW



Gives you copy/paste urls to Look Up your items easily.

The links simply go to classic.wowhead.com.

This addon requires Prat 3.0 as a dependency: https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/prat-3-0.

When you move an item in your inventory the url will be clickable in your chat window.

 

***Moving an item will be changed as a way to make the url appear in the next version, to something less clunky.</p>
